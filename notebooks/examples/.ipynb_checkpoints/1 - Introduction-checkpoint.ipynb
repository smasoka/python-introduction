    "\n",
    "Python is a modern programming language that \n",
    "* is open source\n",
    "* is interpreted\n",
    " * interpreters exist for most platforms\n",
    "* is multi-paradigm (incl. object-oriented)\n",
    "* comes with [batteries included](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy) whenever possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 of the Python language (2.7 is the current minor version) is what made Python popular. However it was far from perfect, and version 3 of Python fixes many of the most glaring design flaws in Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because version 2 gained popularity rapidly, it has taken over 10 years for version 3 to gain foothold. This is the first time CSC gives introduction to Python course using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three levels of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 levels of functionality you can use in Python\n",
    "* the built-in parts\n",
    " * the language itself that is used to write programs\n",
    "* the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)\n",
    " * these cover many common tasks in programming in general, e.g.\n",
    "   * file system and operating system abstraction\n",
    "   * reading standardized file formats (zip, xml, csv, etc.)\n",
    "   * most common data communications protocols (HTTP and email protocols)\n",
    "   * more data types, programming libraries\n",
    "* the Python ecosystem, mostly available via the [Python Package Index PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)\n",
    "   * tens of thousands of packages of varying quality\n",
    "   * libraries for\n",
    "    * numeric computation (e.g. NumPy)\n",
    "    * machine learning (e.g. scikit-learn)\n",
    "    * HTTP frameworks (e.g. Django)\n",
    "    * natural language analysis (e.g. nltk)\n",
    "    * data visualization\n",
    "    \n",
    "The core or built-in parts of Python is relatively small and we will cover that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical way to write python programs is to write it in script files that end in *.py and that can be run with the ``python`` command. We will get to that later but first we use this Jupyter Notebook to go over the basics of the language."
